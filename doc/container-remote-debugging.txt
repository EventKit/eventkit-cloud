When running `docker-compose up` add the following env variable settings:

 - DEV_MACHINE_CODE_PATH the absolute path to your eventkit-cloud directory (Mine is /home/jivan/.projects/eventkit-cloud)
 - CONTAINER_CODE_PATH the absolute path to the path in the container (Currently /var/lib/eventkit)

Add this to your code shortly before where you would like to break
    `from pydevd import settrace; settrace('<host_ip_from_container>')`

<host_ip_from_container>
 - Linux:
    You can get/check this value by entering one of the containers and running `ip route | grep default`
 - MacOSX:
    # From: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/networking/#use-cases-and-workarounds
    `sudo ifconfig lo0 alias 10.200.10.1/24`
    10.200.10.1 is your <host_ip_from_container>

PyDev:
    Start the pydev server (Insect button with P in Debug view).
PyCharm:
    Run > Edit Configurations...
    Click the + on top left and select "Python Remote Debug"
    "Local host name" = <host_ip_from_container>
    "Port" = 5678
    Click "OK"

Then add breakpoints, run the code, step, inspect, and enjoy.
