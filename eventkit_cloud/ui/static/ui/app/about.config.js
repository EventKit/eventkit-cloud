        `EventKit's mission is to save its users' time and frustration by simplifying
            the process for getting deployment-ready geospatial information.
            EventKit works by configuring geospatial data web services in the application,
            and then exporting that data into a portable data format based on a custom,
            user-provided extent. The results are downloadable and ready-to-use datasets called DataPacks.
            For EventKit v1.1, the maximum allowable size for an Area of Interest (AOI) is set to the approximate size of a large city,
            with scalability improvements coming soon.
            Reach out to us if you need to processs a larger area.`,

            has been converted into various schemas designed to make viewing and visual analysis easier.
            The provided QGIS project file includes styling with icons and neatly groups raster data.

                    DataPacks include both a qgs file for use in QGIS and a script for generating an mxd for use in ArcGIS.
                    If you have QGIS installed, simply extract the zip file and open the qgs file.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Support for ArcGIS is limited in EventKit v1.1 with improvements coming soon.
                    After downloading your DataPack and unzipping it, you’ll see a python script called “create_mxd”.
                    Provided you have ArcGIS installed, you can double click this script to generate an mxd for use in ArcGIS.
                    This works best in ArcGIS 10.5.1 and above, with partial support down to 10.4

                     and our next few releases include improvements across a range of topics.
                     In general these include more datasets, formats, and projections,
                     the ability to preview data sources, ways to pre-build,
                     recommend, and discover new datasets, ability to process larger areas, and continued integrations into QGIS and ESRI.
