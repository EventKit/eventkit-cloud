The current version of these \"Terms of Use\" is accessible by clicking on the hyperlink located on the perimeter of the NGA websites.\r\n\r\n(U) GVS TERMS OF USE\r\n(U//FOUO) The GVS Program is one of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency's (NGA's) flagship programs that delivers geospatial visualization capabilities and services to the Department of Defense (DoD) and Intelligence Community (IC) via classified and unclassified computer networks.\r\n(U//FOUO) The goal of GVS is to enhance the imagery and geospatial analysts' exploitation experience by providing comprehensive, web-services based, 2-D and 3-D GEOINT visualization services and environments to enable automated information access, staging and organizational service, visualization of the information in a\r\ngeospatial context, geospatial analysis services, and integration with reporting services.\r\n(U//FOUO) GVS provides robust geospatial visualization, information sharing and collaboration capabilities for the National System for Geospatial-Intelligence (NSG), Intelligence Community, the DoD and its national defense partners (US, Allied, and coalition partners), homeland security, diplomatic, and law enforcement partners on the World Wide Web, NIPRNet, SIPRNet, and JWICS.\r\n(U) Under the direction of the NGA Information Technology (IT) Services Director, GVS provides the operational means to deliver enabling geospatial visualization services supporting the objectives of the NSG and the DoD Designed Enterprise Service for Geospatial Visualization on behalf of the DoD Chief Information Officer (CIO) as part of Defense Information Systems Agency's (DISA) Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) Program.\r\nSpecifics of these services are located on the GVS Homepages.\r\n\r\n(U) General Usage Provisions\r\n(U) Use of GVS Services is limited to official government business. Use of GVS Services for personal/nonofficial use (e.g., casual browsing, gaming, entertainment, personal communications, commerce) is prohibited.\r\nProhibited uses of GVS Services include:\r\n- (U) Use of file sharing technologies, also known as Peer-to-Peer (P2P) software, unless specifically authorized in writing by the appropriate information system security official\r\n- (U) Unauthorized acquisition, use, reproduction, transmission, or distribution of any controlled information including computer software and data, that includes privacy information, copyrighted, trademarked or material with other intellectual property rights (beyond fair use), proprietary data, or export controlled software or data\r\n- (U) Making offensive, indecent, harassing, or disparaging statements\r\n- (U) Making disparaging statements concerning race, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, or political expression\r\n- (U) Streaming video/audio unrelated to official business\r\n- (U) Unlawful or unauthorized access to personally identifiable information related to United States Persons\r\n\r\n(U) NGA Services collect and maintain activity (audit) logs of browsing activity. These logs are made available upon request by an authorized security/law enforcement official (e.g., Information/Computer Security Officer, Inspector General).\r\n\r\n(U) Domestic Imagery\r\n(U//FOUO) GVS serves as a broker to existing content, expertise, and services across the NSG. GVS enables existing sourced and collected NSG content through derived online, on-demand, geospatial web services. This content supports the full spectrum of NSG missions, many of which are non-intelligence functions and exempted from the Department of Defense's intelligence oversight procedures. Because GVS merely enables access to content, and does not collect or exploit content for an intelligence purpose, GVS does not constitute a Foreign Intelligence (FI) or Counterintelligence (CI) activity for purposes of DoD Manual 5240.01 or the NSG domestic imagery policy, NSG Instruction 1806. Although GVS platforms provide access to domestic imagery and data subject to NSG Instruction 1806, none of the GVS platforms are required to maintain a Proper Use Memorandum.\r\n(U//FOUO) Any user of GVS seeking to collect, exploit, or disseminate domestic imagery through GVS must comply with the requirements of NSG Instruction 1806, including the requirement for a Proper Use Memorandum when collecting domestic imagery for a Foreign Intelligence (FI) or Counterintelligence (CI) purpose. GVS\r\nsystems that provide access to domestic imagery will apply access control measures and log auditable information about access requests. Any user seeking to collect domestic imagery through GVS must have a valid mission requirement for that imagery.\r\n\r\n(U) Intelligence Oversight\r\n(U) As a broker to existing content, GVS performs a non-intelligence function for purposes of the Department of Defense's intelligence oversight procedures. Systems with NGA-provided base layers are performing a mapping, charting, and geodetic function that is not governed by Department of Defense Manual 5240.01.\r\n(U) If a GVS user introduces intelligence reporting to the system, either manually or by linking to an external database, that information may be subject to DoDM 5240.01. The Department of Defense defines U.S. Person Information (USPI) as information that is reasonably likely to identify one or more specific U.S. persons, including names or unique titles, street addresses, and telephone numbers. GVS users must comply with all laws, policies, and procedures applicable to the protection of USPI. Users introducing USPI into a GVS system must identify any access and use limitations applicable to the USPI being provided.\r\n(U) The use of a GVS system to intentionally collect USPI for a Foreign Intelligence (FI) or Counterintelligence (CI) purpose requires a prior legal review from NGA's Office of General Counsel (OGC). Any questions about the applicability of DoD's intelligence oversight procedures to GVS operations should be directed to the NGA OGC.\r\n\r\n(U) External Links\r\n(U) The appearance of hyperlinks does not constitute endorsement by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency or this Web site or the information, products or services contained therein. For other than authorized activities such as military exchanges and Morale, Welfare and Recreation sites, the National Geospatial-\r\nIntelligence Agency does not exercise any editorial control over the information you may find at these locations.\r\nSuch links are provided consistent with the stated purpose of this DoD Web site.\r\n\r\n(U) Security and Consent to Monitoring\r\n(U) For security purposes and to ensure that these Services remain available to all users, this Government computer system employs software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to access, change, or otherwise cause damage. Anyone using this system expressly consents to such monitoring\r\nand is advised that if such monitoring reveals evidence of possible abuse or criminal activity, such evidence may be provided to appropriate law enforcement officials. Unauthorized attempts to access, change, or otherwise cause damage on this system are strictly prohibited and may be punishable by administrative discipline, civil penalties, and/or criminal prosecution under the provisions of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act of 1996 (18 USC section 1030). The following security banner/notice is required on all NGA websites and websites registered on NGA:\r\n\r\n- (U) Notice and Consent Log-on Banner\r\n- (U) This is a United States (US) Government computer system. This computer system, including all related equipment, networks, and network devices, including Internet access, are provided only for authorized US Government use. US Government computer systems may be monitored for all lawful purposes, including ensuring that their use is authorized, for management of the system, to facilitate protection against unauthorized access, and to verify security procedures, survivability, and operational security. Monitoring includes authorized attacks by authorized US Government entities to test or verify the security of this system. During monitoring, information may be examined, recorded, copied, and used for authorized purposes. All information including personal information, placed on or sent over this system may be monitored.\r\n- (U) Use of this US Government system, authorized or unauthorized, constitutes consent to monitoring of this system. Unauthorized use may subject you to criminal prosecution. Evidence of unauthorized use collected during monitoring may be used for administrative, criminal or other adverse actions.\r\n(U) Servers registered on NGA systems require the use of an equivalent to the above log-on banner prior to registration of websites on NGA Services.\r\n\r\n(U) Classified National Security Information\r\n(U) Information derived from or created as a consequence of the use of NGA Services may be subject to classification as national security information in accordance with Executive Order 12958, as amended. The Executive Order prescribes a uniform system for classifying, safeguarding, and declassifying national security information. It also establishes a monitoring system to enhance its effectiveness.\r\n(U) Classified information, regardless of its form, shall be afforded a level of protection against loss or unauthorized disclosure commensurate with its level of classification. Authorized persons who have access to classified information are responsible for: (a) Protecting it from persons without authorized access to that information, to include securing it in approved equipment or facilities whenever it is not under the direct control of an authorized person; (b) Meeting safeguarding requirements prescribed by the agency head; and (c) Ensuring that classified information is not communicated over unsecured voice or data circuits, in public conveyances or places, or in any other manner that permits interception by unauthorized persons.\r\n(U) Questions concerning the classification, safeguarding, and declassifying national security information should be directed to your local security officer.\r\n\r\n(U) User Accounts, Passwords, and Security\r\n(U) Some NGA Services may require registration and the use of a password and/or user identification. Individual users are responsible for protecting the confidentiality of passwords against unauthorized disclosure or use by another individual. Individuals are accountable for the actions and behaviors used under these accounts.\r\n(U) In the event a Non-Person Entity (NPE) certificate has been issued to grant users access to GVS provided services or data, it is the responsibility of Local Registration Authority to validate NPE certificate requirements and authenticate subscribers for their particular agencies/organization. Such organizations have the responsibility to ensure a proper mechanism is followed (e.g., username/password) prior to returning protected GVS data through an NPE.\r\n\r\n(U) Protection of Personal Information\r\n(U) The Privacy Act of 1974 (as Amended), Public Law 93-579, requires Federal agencies to inform individuals when they are asked to provide their Social Security Numbers (SSN) and other personal identifiers. In the event a SSN is requested, you are hereby advised that the authority for soliciting your SSN is Executive Order 9397.\r\nA SSN may be used for individual identification and integrity functions within NGA identification or authorization mechanisms. NGA does not typically request or require SSNs. NGA primarily uses names, email addresses, and organizational information to enable use of its Services.\r\n(U) Posting of, or making available, personal identifiers such social security account numbers may violate an individual's right to privacy under the Privacy Act (5 USC 552a) and is prohibited.\r\n\r\n(U) Crawling, Indexing, and Search Policy\r\n(U) Search engine tools are typically referred to as robots, crawlers, walkers, or spiders that use hyperlink structures of web-based content to find and index content. NGA search engines are the only content indexing mechanisms authorized to crawl Intelligence Community hosts visible on Community networks. This facilitates\r\nbroad community access to shared content as well as providing the capability address general community needs (e.g., security incidents/spills response, bandwidth limitations).\r\n(U) The NGA search engine indexes HTML and non-HTML content (e.g., pdf, word processing, spreadsheets, graphics, presentations, and text files). The NGA search mechanisms honor the Robots Exclusion Protocol. A \"robots.txt\" files should be used to limit indexing of named directories (e.g., private content, cgi-bin directories).\r\nOur responsibility to limit adverse impacts from indexing is taken very seriously. Problems with NGA crawlers accessing community websites should be reported immediately via email to NGA.\r\n\r\n(U) Official Federal Agency Record Responsibilities\r\n(U) Section 3101 of Title 44 USC requires the head of each Federal agency to make and preserve records containing adequate and proper documentation of the rganization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures and essential transactions of the agency and designed to furnish the information necessary to protect the legal and financial rights of the Government and of persons directly affected by the agency's activities. Federal employees have three basic obligations for making and keeping records of their work including:\r\n- (U) Creating records needed to do the business of their agency, record decisions and actions taken, and document activities for which they are responsible\r\n- (U) Taking care that records are kept so that information can be found when needed. This means setting up good directories and files, and filing materials (in whatever format) regularly and carefully in a manner that allows them to be safely stored and efficiently retrieved when necessary\r\n- (U) Carrying out the disposition of records under their control in accordance with agency records schedules and Federal regulations\r\n- (U) Management of record material created or used as a consequence of the use of NGA Services, is the responsibility of the individual user and his/her agency.\r\n\r\n(U) Cookies\r\n(U) A \"cookie\" is small amount of data, typically an anonymous but unique identifier, sent to a browser by a web server and may be saved to user's computer to facilitate convenient use of certain website features. Session cookies are used for the duration of a session connection with the visited website. Session cookies are typically deleted at the end of a browsing session - when the browser is closed. Persistent cookies are saved to a user's computer to allow recognition of a user and/or their preferences the next time the user visits the same website.\r\n(U) Some NGA Services features use persistent cookies to provide seamless navigation and recognition of user preferences previously set by the user. Web browsers allow a user to configure how cookies behave - allow/disallow or control the use of cookies. Certain features of NGA Services work best when persistent cookies\r\nare allowed by the browser.\r\n\r\n(U) Copyrights, Intellectual Property, and Commercial Content\r\n(U) Generally, materials produced by Federal agencies are in the public domain and may be reproduced without permission. However, not all content provided via NGA Services is in the public domain. Some content is licensed or obtained from individuals, organizations, or commercial entities and may be subject to restrictions on use.\r\n(U) Some NGA Services contain commercial content (e.g., Janes, CNN, Weather) licensed by the United States Government under specific license agreements that govern its use. Reproduction or redistribution of the commercially provided or licensed content is prohibited by law, and may result in civil and criminal penalties.\r\nYou may consult our staff for details on specific items. We will be able to refer you to our content providers, but may not be able to confirm the copyright status of specific items.\r\n(U) Images and other material used on NGA systems that are in the public domain may be used without restriction. Some material on NGA systems have been obtained from other agencies. Permission to use these materials should be obtained directly from those agencies/organizations.\r\n\r\n(U) Availability of Public Domain or Open Source Software\r\n(U) Public domain or open source software may be made available on NGA systems for the convenience of the user community when deemed appropriate and consistent with the objectives for which NGA Services are provided. The availability of these resources does not constitute or imply its endorsement, recommendation, suitability determination for any purpose, or favoring by the United States Government. Verification and compliance with any licensing requirements is the exclusive responsibility of the user and organization using any software made available through NGA Services.

      "text": "ODC Open Database License (ODbL)\r\nPreamble\r\nThe Open Database License (ODbL) is a license agreement intended to\r\nallow users to freely share, modify, and use this Database while\r\nmaintaining this same freedom for others. Many databases are covered by\r\ncopyright, and therefore this document licenses these rights. Some\r\njurisdictions, mainly in the European Union, have specific rights that\r\ncover databases, and so the ODbL addresses these rights, too. Finally,\r\nthe ODbL is also an agreement in contract for users of this Database to\r\nact in certain ways in return for accessing this Database.\r\n\r\nDatabases can contain a wide variety of types of content (images,\r\naudiovisual material, and sounds all in the same database, for example),\r\nand so the ODbL only governs the rights over the Database, and not the\r\ncontents of the Database individually. Licensors should use the ODbL\r\ntogether with another license for the contents, if the contents have a\r\nsingle set of rights that uniformly covers all of the contents. If the\r\ncontents have multiple sets of different rights, Licensors should\r\ndescribe what rights govern what contents together in the individual\r\nrecord or in some other way that clarifies what rights apply.\r\n\r\nSometimes the contents of a database, or the database itself, can be\r\ncovered by other rights not addressed here (such as private contracts,\r\ntrade mark over the name, or privacy rights / data protection rights\r\nover information in the contents), and so you are advised that you may\r\nhave to consult other documents or clear other rights before doing\r\nactivities not covered by this License.\r\n\r\nThe Licensor (as defined below)\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\nYou (as defined below)\r\n\r\nagree as follows:\r\n\r\n1.0 Definitions of Capitalised Words\r\n???Collective Database??? ??? Means this Database in unmodified form as part\r\nof a collection of independent databases in themselves that together are\r\nassembled into a collective whole.

The contents of this Database, which includes the\r\ninformation, independent works, or other material collected into the\r\nDatabase. For example, the contents of the Database could be factual\r\ndata or works such as images, audiovisual material, text, or sounds.\r\n\r\n???Database??? ??? A collection of material (the Contents) arranged in a\r\nsystematic or methodical way and individually accessible by electronic\r\nor other means offered under the terms of this License.\r\n\r\n???Database Directive??? ??? Means Directive 96/9/EC of the European\r\nParliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection\r\nof databases, as amended or succeeded.\r\n\r\n???Database Right??? ??? Means rights resulting from the Chapter III (???sui\r\ngeneris???) rights in the Database Directive (as amended and as transposed\r\nby member states), which includes the Extraction and Re-utilisation of\r\nthe whole or a Substantial part of the Contents, as well as any similar\r\nrights available in the relevant jurisdiction under Section 10.4.\r\n\r\n???Derivative Database??? ??? Means a database based upon the Database, and\r\nincludes any translation, adaptation, arrangement, modification, or any\r\nother alteration of the Database or of a Substantial part of the\r\nContents. This includes, but is not limited to, Extracting or\r\nRe-utilising the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents in a new\r\nDatabase.\r\n\r\n???Extraction??? ??? Means the permanent or temporary transfer of all or a\r\nSubstantial part of the Contents to another medium by any means or in\r\nany form.\r\n\r\n???License??? ???

As a verb, means doing any act that is restricted by copyright\r\nor Database Rights whether in the original medium or any other; and\r\nincludes without limitation distributing, copying, publicly performing,\r\npublicly displaying, and preparing derivative works of the Database, as\r\nwell as modifying the Database as may be technically necessary to use it\r\nin a different mode or format.\r\n\r\n???You??? ??? Means a Person exercising rights under this License who has not\r\npreviously violated the terms of this License with respect to the\r\nDatabase, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to\r\nexercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.\r\n\r\nWords in the singular include the plural and vice versa.\r\n\r\n2.0 What this License covers\r\n2.1. Legal effect of this document. This License is:\r\n\r\n      a. A license of applicable copyright and neighbouring rights;\r\n\r\n      b. A license of the Database Right; and\r\n\r\n      c. An agreement in contract between You and the Licensor.\r\n\r\n2.2 Legal rights covered. This License covers the legal rights in the\r\nDatabase, including:\r\n\r\n      a. Copyright. Any copyright or neighbouring rights in the Database.\r\nThe copyright licensed includes any individual elements of the\r\nDatabase, but does not cover the copyright over the Contents\r\nindependent of this Database. See Section 2.4 for details. Copyright\r\nlaw varies between jurisdictions, but is likely to cover: the Database\r\nmodel or schema, which is the structure, arrangement, and organisation\r\nof the Database, and can also include the Database tables and table\r\nindexes; the data entry and output sheets; and the Field names of\r\nContents stored in the Database;\r\n\r\n      b. Database Rights. Database Rights only extend to the Extraction and\r\nRe-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of the Contents.\r\nDatabase Rights can apply even when there is no copyright over the\r\n      Database. Database Rights can also apply when the Contents are removed\r\nfrom the Database and are selected and arranged in a way that would\r\nnot infringe any applicable copyright; and\r\n\r\n      c. Contract. This is an agreement between You and the Licensor for\r\naccess to the Database. In return you agree to certain conditions of\r\nuse on this access as outlined in this License.\r\n\r\n2.3 Rights not covered.\r\n\r\n      a. This License does not apply to computer programs used in the making\r\nor operation of the Database;\r\n\r\n      b. This License does not cover any patents over the Contents or the\r\nDatabase; and\r\n\r\n      c. This License does not cover any trademarks associated with the\r\n      Database.\r\n\r\n2.4 Relationship to Contents in the Database. The individual items of\r\nthe Contents contained in this Database may be covered by other rights,\r\nincluding copyright, patent, data protection, privacy, or personality\r\nrights, and this License does not cover any rights (other than Database\r\nRights or in contract) in individual Contents contained in the Database.\r\nFor example, if used on a Database of images (the Contents), this\r\nLicense would not apply to copyright over individual images, which could\r\nhave their own separate licenses, or one single license covering all of\r\nthe rights over the images.\r\n\r\n3.0 Rights granted\r\n3.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the Licensor\r\ngrants to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, terminable (but\r\nonly under Section 9) license to Use the Database for the duration of\r\nany applicable copyright and Database Rights. These rights explicitly\r\ninclude commercial use, and do not exclude any field of endeavour. To\r\nthe extent possible in the relevant jurisdiction, these rights may be\r\nexercised in all media and formats whether now known or created in the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nThe rights granted cover, for example:\r\n\r\n      a. Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of\r\nthe Contents;\r\n\r\n      b. Creation of Derivative Databases;\r\n\r\n      c. Creation of Collective Databases;\r\n\r\n      d. Creation of temporary or permanent reproductions by any means and\r\nin any form, in whole or in part, including of any Derivative\r\nDatabases or as a part of Collective Databases; and\r\n\r\n      e. Distribution, communication, display, lending, making available, or\r\nperformance to the public by any means and in any form, in whole or in\r\npart, including of any Derivative Database or as a part of Collective\r\n      Databases.\r\n\r\n3.2 Compulsory license schemes. For the avoidance of doubt:\r\n\r\n      a. Non-waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in\r\nwhich the right to collect royalties through any statutory or\r\ncompulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves\r\nthe exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You\r\nof the rights granted under this License;\r\n\r\n      b. Waivable compulsory license schemes. In those jurisdictions in\r\nwhich the right to collect royalties through any statutory or\r\ncompulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the\r\nexclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of\r\nthe rights granted under this License; and,\r\n\r\n      c. Voluntary license schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect\r\nroyalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is\r\na member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing\r\nschemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights\r\ngranted under this License.\r\n\r\n3.3 The right to release the Database under different terms, or to stop\r\ndistributing or making available the Database, is reserved. Note that\r\nthis Database may be multiple-licensed, and so You may have the choice\r\nof using alternative licenses for this Database. Subject to Section\r\n10.4, all other rights not expressly granted by Licensor are reserved.\r\n\r\n4.0 Conditions of Use\r\n4.1 The rights granted in Section 3 above are expressly made subject to\r\nYour complying with the following conditions of use. These are important\r\nconditions of this License, and if You fail to follow them, You will be\r\nin material breach of its terms.\r\n\r\n4.2 Notices. If You Publicly Convey this Database, any Derivative\r\nDatabase, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, then You\r\nmust:\r\n\r\n      a. Do so only under the terms of this License or another license\r\npermitted under Section 4.4;\r\n\r\n      b. Include a copy of this License (or, as applicable, a license\r\npermitted under Section 4.4) or its Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)\r\nwith the Database or Derivative Database, including both in the\r\nDatabase or Derivative Database and in any relevant documentation; and\r\n\r\n      c. Keep intact any copyright or Database Right notices and notices\r\nthat refer to this License.\r\n\r\n      d. If it is not possible to put the required notices in a particular\r\nfile due to its structure, then You must include the notices in a\r\nlocation (such as a relevant directory) where users would be likely to\r\nlook for it.\r\n\r\n4.3 Notice for using output (Contents). Creating and Using a Produced\r\nWork does not require the notice in Section 4.2. However, if you\r\nPublicly Use a Produced Work, You must include a notice associated with\r\nthe Produced Work reasonably calculated to make any Person that uses,\r\nviews, accesses, interacts with, or is otherwise exposed to the Produced\r\nWork aware that Content was obtained from the Database, Derivative\r\nDatabase, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, and that it\r\nis available under this License.\r\n\r\n      a. Example notice. The following text will satisfy notice under\r\nSection 4.3:\r\n\r\n    Contains information from DATABASE NAME, which is made available\r\n    here under the Open Database License (ODbL).\r\nDATABASE NAME should be replaced with the name of the Database and a\r\nhyperlink to the URI of the Database. ???Open Database License??? should\r\ncontain a hyperlink to the URI of the text of this License. If\r\nhyperlinks are not possible, You should include the plain text of the\r\nrequired URI???s with the above notice.\r\n\r\n4.4 Share alike.\r\n\r\n      a. Any Derivative Database that You Publicly Use must be only under\r\nthe terms of:\r\n\r\n           i. This License;\r\n\r\n           ii. A later version of this License similar in spirit to this\r\nLicense; or\r\n\r\n           iii. A compatible license.\r\n\r\nIf You license the Derivative Database under one of the licenses\r\nmentioned in (iii), You must comply with the terms of that license.\r\n\r\n      b. For the avoidance of doubt, Extraction or Re-utilisation of the\r\nwhole or a Substantial part of the Contents into a new database is a\r\nDerivative Database and must comply with Section 4.4.\r\n\r\n      c. Derivative Databases and Produced Works. A Derivative Database is\r\nPublicly Used and so must comply with Section 4.4. if a Produced Work\r\ncreated from the Derivative Database is Publicly Used.\r\n\r\n      d. Share Alike and additional Contents. For the avoidance of doubt,\r\nYou must not add Contents to Derivative Databases under Section 4.4 a\r\nthat are incompatible with the rights granted under this License.\r\n\r\n      e. Compatible licenses. Licensors may authorise a proxy to determine\r\ncompatible licenses under Section 4.4 a iii. If they do so, the\r\nauthorised proxy???s public statement of acceptance of a compatible\r\nlicense grants You permission to use the compatible license.\r\n\r\n4.5 Limits of Share Alike. The requirements of Section 4.4 do not apply\r\nin the following:\r\n\r\n      a. For the avoidance of doubt, You are not required to license\r\nCollective Databases under this License if You incorporate this\r\nDatabase or a Derivative Database in the collection, but this License\r\nstill applies to this Database or a Derivative Database as a part of\r\nthe Collective Database;\r\n\r\n      b. Using this Database, a Derivative Database, or this Database as\r\npart of a Collective Database to create a Produced Work does not\r\ncreate a Derivative Database for purposes of Section 4.4; and\r\n\r\n      c. Use of a Derivative Database internally within an organisation is\r\nnot to the public and therefore does not fall under the requirements\r\nof Section 4.4.\r\n\r\n4.6 Access to Derivative Databases. If You Publicly Use a Derivative\r\nDatabase or a Produced Work from a Derivative Database, You must also\r\noffer to recipients of the Derivative Database or Produced Work a copy\r\nin a machine readable form of:\r\n\r\n      a. The entire Derivative Database; or\r\n\r\n      b. A file containing all of the alterations made to the Database or\r\nthe method of making the alterations to the Database (such as an\r\nalgorithm), including any additional Contents, that make up all the\r\ndifferences between the Database and the Derivative Database.\r\n\r\nThe Derivative Database (under a.) or alteration file (under b.) must be\r\navailable at no more than a reasonable production cost for physical\r\ndistributions and free of charge if distributed over the internet.\r\n\r\n4.7 Technological measures and additional terms\r\n\r\n      a. This License does not allow You to impose (except subject to\r\nSection 4.7 b.) any terms or any technological measures on the\r\nDatabase, a Derivative Database, or the whole or a Substantial part of\r\nthe Contents that alter or restrict the terms of this License, or any\r\nrights granted under it, or have the effect or intent of restricting\r\nthe ability of any person to exercise those rights.\r\n\r\n      b. Parallel distribution. You may impose terms or technological\r\nmeasures on the Database, a Derivative Database, or the whole or a\r\nSubstantial part of the Contents (a ???Restricted Database???) in\r\ncontravention of Section 4.74 a. only if You also make a copy of the\r\nDatabase or a Derivative Database available to the recipient of the\r\nRestricted Database:\r\n\r\n           i. That is available without additional fee;\r\n\r\n           ii. That is available in a medium that does not alter or restrict\r\nthe terms of this License, or any rights granted under it, or have\r\nthe effect or intent of restricting the ability of any person to\r\nexercise those rights (an ???Unrestricted Database???); and\r\n\r\n           iii. The Unrestricted Database is at least as accessible to the\r\nrecipient as a practical matter as the Restricted Database.\r\n\r\n      c. For the avoidance of doubt, You may place this Database or a\r\nDerivative Database in an authenticated environment, behind a\r\npassword, or within a similar access control scheme provided that You\r\ndo not alter or restrict the terms of this License or any rights\r\ngranted under it or have the effect or intent of restricting the\r\nability of any person to exercise those rights.\r\n\r\n4.8 Licensing of others. You may not sublicense the Database. Each time\r\nYou communicate the Database, the whole or Substantial part of the\r\nContents, or any Derivative Database to anyone else in any way, the\r\nLicensor offers to the recipient a license to the Database on the same\r\nterms and conditions as this License. You are not responsible for\r\nenforcing compliance by third parties with this License, but You may\r\nenforce any rights that You have over a Derivative Database. You are\r\nsolely responsible for any modifications of a Derivative Database made\r\nby You or another Person at Your direction. You may not impose any\r\nfurther restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed\r\nunder this License.\r\n\r\n5.0 Moral rights\r\n5.1 Moral rights. This section covers moral rights, including any rights\r\nto be identified as the author of the Database or to object to treatment\r\nthat would otherwise prejudice the author???s honour and reputation, or\r\nany other derogatory treatment:\r\n\r\n      a. For jurisdictions allowing waiver of moral rights, Licensor waives\r\nall moral rights that Licensor may have in the Database to the fullest\r\nextent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under Section\r\n      10.4;\r\n\r\n      b.
