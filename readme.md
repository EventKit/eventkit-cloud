Eventkit-Cloud
==============

Eventkit-cloud is based on the [HOT OSM Export Tool](https://github.com/hotosm/osm-export-tool).  It allows the user to select data from different sources to export into a variety of formats.
  
It is used to expose OSM and various OGC and ArcGIS services and allow users to generate datasets based on a map selection.
These datasets will automatically include a map file (QGIS and ArcGIS), and can be made available for other users to download.
